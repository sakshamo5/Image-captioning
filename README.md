#Image Captioning App

This repository contains an Image Captioning App built with Streamlit and deployed for easy access. The app uses DenseNet for image feature extraction and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for generating captions.

🚀 Features

📸 Upload Images: Easily upload images for caption generation.

🖼️ Real-time Captioning: Generates captions within seconds.

🧠 Deep Learning Models: Utilizes DenseNet for feature extraction and LSTM for caption generation.

🌐 Streamlit Web Interface: User-friendly, responsive, and accessible on desktop and mobile devices.

💾 Model Persistence: Pre-trained models loaded efficiently for smooth performance.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

TensorFlow / Keras

Streamlit

DenseNet for image processing

LSTM for natural language processing

PIL (Pillow) for image handling

📑 Installation

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning-app.git
cd image-captioning-app

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit App

streamlit run app.py

📷 Usage

Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

Upload an image.

Wait for the model to generate captions.

View and share the generated caption.

⚙️ Model Architecture

Feature Extractor: DenseNet pre-trained on ImageNet.

Caption Generator: LSTM network trained on image-caption datasets.

🧠 Model Training

The DenseNet and LSTM models were trained on a large image-caption dataset (e.g., MS COCO). Training scripts can be found in the notebooks directory.

🚧 Future Improvements

Improve model accuracy with more diverse datasets.

Optimize model inference time for better performance.

Add multilingual caption support.
